# Interactive Setup

This post demonstrates how real-world decisions differ from multiple choice questions.

## Question
What should Apple do right now about Siri?

## Options
1. Release an assistant that might not meet Apple's historic standards
2. Continue to delay the launch until it reaches their standards  
3. Purchase a company like Cohere that could accelerate their AI progress
4. Be the counter of the AI hype and push against it

## Follow-up
- **Question**: "So which is the correct answer?"
- **Subheading**: "Is there a correct answer?"
- **Description**: "This is what a question in real life looks like."

Yet, to prepare kids for this we simplify the world. Tell them we know all the answers. That's what school teaches you: the answers.

**Life is not chess, it's poker. There's uncertainty. There isn't a correct answer.**

I get why we do this. Multiple choice is efficient. It scales. It's fair. Everyone gets the same test, same scoring. We can teach thousands of kids with limited resources.

**But we've created two problems that feed each other:**

> **First, we're teaching the wrong thing.** We present a world of right and wrong answers when reality is all trade-offs and uncertainty. The Apple/Siri question? That's what actual decisions look like.
> 
> **Second, we're measuring the wrong thing.** Even when we try to teach real skills—critical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making—we test them with bubble sheets. We look at the destination, not the journey. A kid who guessed right looks the same as one who reasoned brilliantly.

These aren't separate issues. They're a vicious cycle. We simplify to evaluate at scale, then we evaluate based on those simplifications, which forces us to simplify even more.

Teachers know this. They see how students think, where they struggle, what clicks. But one teacher can only deeply evaluate so many students. The system forces them to fall back on standardized tests.

**What if AI could amplify what great teachers already do? Not replace them—supercharge them.**

Imagine a teacher assigns the Apple/Siri dilemma. Students write their analysis. AI helps the teacher see every student's reasoning process—where they considered trade-offs, how they handled uncertainty, what frameworks they applied. The teacher can now guide thirty students as deeply as they used to guide three.

We could teach real-world complexity AND evaluate it fairly. Students could grapple with messy questions. Teachers could actually teach thinking, not just answers.

**The tools to break the cycle might finally be here. The question is: are we ready to admit that the most important skills don't have right or wrong answers?**
